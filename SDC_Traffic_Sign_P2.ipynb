    "Then started to change the dimensions of LeNet try to get better accuracy. That took me to add extra data by generating the training set data with some rotation to get more data, change hyperparameters until I got this architecture with dimensions and parameters that I used in this project which gives me better than 98%. Simplicity is always in my mind to solve any problems where I consider the time to train the model as well.\n",
    "Since this model might not be suitable for the large data set but for this data set it is quite okay. Of course I think I might be able to improve this by using thoughtful added data as well as adding L2 regularization or normalize the training data set. Also I would like to try out with changing the training data to be in grayscale."
